**[Release] Unofficial Telegram & Discord Bridges for Agent Zero**

Hi everyone,

For my first post here, I'm sharing two standalone bridges I've built that allow you to chat with your Agent Zero instance remotely via **Telegram** and **Discord**.

These are intended as interim solutions to help us connect with our agents on the go until official native integrations are implemented.

**What they do**
Lightweight Python scripts that run inside your Agent Zero Docker container, bridging messages between the chat platform and Agent Zero's API.

**Key Features**
- **Functional:** Chat from phone or desktop.
- **Persistent:** Auto-starts with container (Optional).
- **Cost Efficient:** Zero idle costs.
- **Private:** Local execution.
